1_TCA_4.png shows the amount of glucose, NADH, ComplexI agents and quinols.

The rule that we ativate this time is:
'Complex I produces QH2' ComplexI(FMN~H) ->ComplexI(FMN~0) |'NADH in CI':Quinol @ 'Complex I out' #Complex I reduces the Quinol 

A molecule of NADH in Complex I results in one quinol. This is why the amount of Quinols we get from Complex I is set to 'NADH in CI'.

Active rules:
'TCA consumes Glucose'
'TCA produces NADH and succinate'
'Complex I consumes NADH'
'Complex I produces QH2'

### Observe ###
%obs: 'glucose'		|Glucose|*1000 #We need the multiplication by 1E3 because we do not use the same units for glucose as we do for ComplexI.
%obs: 'NADH'		|NADH|*1000
%obs: 'Complex I without NADH'	ComplexI(FMN~0)
%obs: 'Complex I with NADH'	ComplexI(FMN~H)
%obs: 'quinols'		|Quinol|*1000
