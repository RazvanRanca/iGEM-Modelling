1_TCA_2.png shows the concentrations of glucose, NADH and succinate over time. The system is modelled so that the TCA cycle "produces" 6 NADH and 2 succinate per molecule of glucose.

Note that the amounts of NADH and succinate reach their desired values long after the glucose is absorbed completely.

Active rules:
'TCA consumes Glucose'\
'TCA produces NADH and succinate'\
