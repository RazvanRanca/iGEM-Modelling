1_TCA_1.png shows the relation betwen the amount of glucose and the number of "running" TCA cycles at a given time.

The relation should be roughly linear with 0.07mM and 0.2 mM bottom and top limit for the TCA cycles, respectively. This numbers were taken from paper 1 in the bibliography.

Active rules:
'TCA consumes Glucose'\
'TCA produces NADH and succinate'\
