EdiGEM12
========

EdiGEM12 is the team from Edinburgh University taking part in the synthetic biology competition iGEM 2012. This repository contains the modelling of the electron transfer in E.Coli (one part of our project). For this we use the stochastic, agent-based language Kappa and its implementation KaSim. More about Kappa and KaSim can be found on http://www.rulebase.org/
