1_TCA_3.png shows the amount of glucose, NADH and ComplexI agents.

The rule that we ativate this time is:
'Complex I consumes NADH' ComplexI(FMN~0) |'NADH in CI':NADH ->ComplexI(FMN~H) @ 'Complex I in' 
'NADH in CI' equals 1E-3. This is because the token NADH is measured in mM, and the agent ComplexI - in muM. When we set the initial number of an agent, this number has to be an integer. Hence, our reasoning to use muM for ComplexI. We also measure the agents ComplexII and TCA in muM.

Active rules:
'TCA consumes Glucose'
'TCA produces NADH and succinate'
'Complex I consumes NADH'

### Observe ###
%obs: 'glucose'		|Glucose|*1000 #We need the multiplication by 1E3 because we do not use the same units for glucose as we do for ComplexI.
%obs: 'NADH'		|NADH|
%obs: 'Complex I without NADH'	ComplexI(FMN~0)
%obs: 'Complex I with NADH'	ComplexI(FMN~H)
